        <h1>Happy New Year!</h1>
        <p>As we usher in a new year, I want to take a moment to reflect on the wonderful journey we've shared. The past year brought its challenges and triumphs, but through it all, your friendship and support have been a guiding light.</p>
        <img src="fireworks.gif" alt="Fireworks" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto;"> <!-- Update the image source to fireworks.gif and add styling for scaling -->
        <p>May the coming year be filled with boundless joy, uncontainable laughter, and a multitude of successes. Let's embrace new opportunities, overcome any obstacles, and create beautiful memories together.</p>
